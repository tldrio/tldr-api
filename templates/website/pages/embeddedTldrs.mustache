You are writing a blogpost and referring to one of Paul Graham's essays, for example "Hackers and Painters". You want your readers to know what it's about
but it is very long. By the time they finished reading it (if they actually finish it), they will have forgotten your post. That's where the embedded
tldrs come in! Just embed the summary of "Hackers and Painters", like this:
</p><br>

<!--
-->
<blockquote class="tldr-embed-widget" data-align="center">      <p>      <a href="http://localhost:8888/tldrs/51434c4e5a94a40d7e000003/chicken-scheme" class="link-to-tldr-page" target="_blank">Summary of "CHICKEN Scheme"</a> (via <a href="http://tldr.io" target="_blank">tldr.io</a>)      <ul>          <li style="margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 130%;">YEAH</li>      </ul>      </p></blockquote><script async src="//localhost:8888/embed/widget-embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<br><p>
And boom, now your readers are on the same page as you, and they will get much more out of your insightful post. You made them smarter, and saved them time,
just like that.
</p>

<p>
You can of course also use embedded tldrs for your own blogposts. Are you writing a pretty long article? Do you think most of your readers will just
close their browser without having read your ideas because they don't have the time? Then just embed the summary of your own post at the top to pique their
curiosity, like this:
</p><br>

<!--
<blockquote data-use-own-tldr="true" class="tldr-embed-widget">
</blockquote><script async src="//localhost:8888/embed/widget-embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
-->
<blockquote class="tldr-embed-widget" data-align="center">      <p>      <a href="http://localhost:8888/tldrs/51434ce241f5833e7f000012/procrastination-is-not-laziness" class="link-to-tldr-page" target="_blank">Summary of "Procrastination Is Not Laziness"</a> (via <a href="http://tldr.io" target="_blank">tldr.io</a>)      <ul>          <li style="margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 130%;">bloups=</li>      </ul>      </p></blockquote><script async src="//localhost:8888/embed/widget-embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
