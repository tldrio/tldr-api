  <h1>The Team</h1>
  <h2 class="marketing-byline">About Us</h2>

  <p>The team is composed of Louis Chatriot, Stanislas Marion and Charles Miglietti.
     For a long time, we had been feeling that the Web was getting harder and harder to navigate.
    Sharing the same passion for the Internet and entrepreneurship, we decided to do something about it and quit our day jobs at the same time to found tldr.io.
    We have already worked together, on an interactive ebook we made with the startup Captain Dash for the French Employersâ€™ Association.

      <p>
        Like many, I'm curious and I love to learn about new things. But the Internet has become hard to navigate and there is too much content
        to choose from. Summaries are the natural solution, as they help people grasp the gist of an article quickly and remember it better.
        But traditional approaches (algorithmic summaries) do not work on free-form content, what we need is a way to get people to summarize the Web. That's why I'm building tldr.io.

      <p>
        Before working on tldr.io, I worked about 2 years as a management consultant for Bain &amp; Company. I gratuated from Ecole Polytechnique and have a MS in
        Management Science and Engineering from Stanford University.

      <p>Work aside, I enjoy squash (a lot), skiing (even more) and occasionally climbing. I'm also a pretty bad but very motivated Go player.

    <div class="span11">
      <p><strong>Cofounder and CEO</strong> I do mostly product design, front-end programming, marketing and community management
      <p>
        I believe the web is revolutionizing how the world works and I want to help make it more accessible to people. I think
        people are having a hard time navigating in the information overload we're enduring and I want to solve that problem.
        This is why I'm building tldr.io.
      </p>

      <p>
        Prior to starting tldr.io I worked for about 2 years at a <a href="http://yseop.com">Parisian startup</a>.
        I also played heads up poker online for a while and was quite successful.
        I graduated from Ecole Centrale Paris and have an MS in Management Science and Engineering from Stanford University.

    <div class="span11">
      <p><strong>Cofounder</strong> I do a lot of Front-end, some backend and I animate tl;dr's users community.</p>
      I like it a lot when things are easy to understand, easy to get hold of and I always thank people who are good at explaining them.
      I'm so happy when grabbing the point is straightforward. I started tldr.io because I find that having access to a summary of anything
      I can read would really be useful. Even writing my own summaries helps me remembering what I read.
      Pooling the individual efforts to make the Internet a smarter place is what I like the most in tldr.io.
      If you want to go hiking on the week end or playing some squash I'm your man!
