  <h1>API documentation</h1>

  <p>
    For now only the read-only part is open, enabling you to get the latest tldrs or to search tldrs by url.
    What's here shouldn't change, but we may add new routes along the way. Still, keep in mind this is experimental
        so don't hesitate to drop us an email at <a href="mailto:hello@tldr.io">hello@tldr.io</a> if you have a question or
    if something doesn't work!
  </p>

  <h2>Url and authentication</h2>
  <p>
    The API base url is: <strong>https://api.tldr.io</strong>.<br><br>
    All requests will contain two extra headers to authenticate them:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>api-client-name</strong>: the name of your application</li>
      <li><strong>api-client-key</strong>: your secret key</li>
    </ul>
    To request a developer account, drop us an email at <a href="mailto:hello@tldr.io">hello@tldr.io</a>, tell us what you want to use our
    API for and we'll create you an acccount. All unauthenticated requests will be answered with a 401 status code explaining you why the request
    was refused.
  </p>

  <h2>GET /tldrs/latest/<em>:number</em></h2>
  <p>
    Get the <em>:number</em> latest tldrs. You can only get between 1 and 10 tldrs.
  </p>

  <h2>GET /tldrs/search?url=<em>:url</em></h2>
  <p>
    Search the summary of the webpage whose url is <em>:url</em>. <em>:url</em> should be properly URL-encoded (for example in Javascript with encodeURIComponent).
    A 404 response means there is no tldr for this url.

  <h2>Clients</h2>
  <p>
    This API is very simple but we still made a Javascript client for the browser. You can find it <a href="https://github.com/tldrio/">here</a>.
