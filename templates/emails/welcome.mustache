The web has become a thick jungle where it’s tough to find one’s way to the right content.
There are a lot of hidden treasures that we would like to put in everybody’s hands.
We think that there is something missing from the web, a tool that helps people find these treasures.
<strong>Filling this gap is our mission and you’re a part of our squad</strong>.

<br>
<br>

Tame the web, you know you want it.
